Title: Rbundler manages an application's dependencies systematically
    and repeatedly.
Description: Rbundler manages project-specific libraries and package
    installations. By specifying dependencies in your project's root
    directory, you may install and use dependencies in a
    repeatable fashion without requiring manual maintenance.
    Rbundler uses a combination of a project-specific R library in
    `PROJECT_ROOT/.Rbundle` (by default) and a project-specific
    `R_LIBS_USER` value, set in `PROJECT_ROOT/.Renviron`.
Depends:
    R (>= 2.15.1),
    devtools (>= 0.7)
Suggests:
    testthat,
