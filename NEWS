rbundler 0.3.0
--------------

* Adds support for installing versioned dependencies for source-type packages.
Retrieves the set of available packages from the current repository's root and
archive (if an archive exists, e.g. in CRAN-like repositories), then
cross-references these packages with the bundled package dependencies, determining
which package versions to install. Constructs a list of URLs of packages to
install, and uses the `devtools` utility function `install_url` to install them.

* Removes `repos` option from the main call to `bundle`. The caller should now have
the repository set in their environment (i.e. using `options(repos='http://myrepo')

* Re-introduces integration tests and adds mock package creation utilities: `create_mock_packages`

* Adds utility functions for discoery of package versions: `find_available_versions`

* Supports CRAN-like Archive directories, as well as single-directory repositories.
